# sbg
A platform for assessment and evaluation of project-based learning through standards-based grading.

# Overview
While systems for standards-based grading exist ([Sesame](https://sesamehq.com), [Edusight](https://edusight.co/)) none provide the complete set of functionality that I consider ideal, as a teacher.

Loosely, the **sbg** system is meant to address this need, and, to serve as an exemplar of how to develop a database driven website using the Agile process for software development known as Scrum.
